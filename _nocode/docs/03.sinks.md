## sinks

Sinks are the destination endpoints where processed events are delivered after passing through the routing system.

Each sink plugin implements how and where to send or store events, such as logging, notifying, saving to a file, or forwarding via HTTP.

## structure

Each sink has:

- A unique name used in route rules.
- A `type` field indicating the sink plugin.
- A `config` section defining plugin-specific parameters.

## configuration format

```yaml
sinks:
  <sink-name>:
    type: <plugin-name>
    config:
      <plugin-specific-fields>
```

## built-in sink types

### stdout-log

Prints the event to standard output in formatted JSON. Useful for debugging.

```yaml
sinks:
  debug-log:
    type: stdout
    config: {}
```

### file-logger

Appends the event to a specified log file.

```yaml
sinks:
  file-logger:
    type: file
    config:
      path: ./logs/events.log
```

#### fields

| Field | Type   | Description                |
|-------|--------|----------------------------|
| path  | string | Absolute or relative path to log file |

### http forwarder

Forwards the event to an external HTTP service.

```yaml
sinks:
  notify-service:
    type: http
    config:
      url: https://example.com/notify
      method: POST
      headers:
        Content-Type: application/json
```

#### fields

| Field          | Type               | Description                                          |
|----------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| url            | string             | Target HTTP endpoint                                 |
| method         | string             | HTTP method (POST, PUT, etc.)                        |
| headers        | map<string,string> | Optional request headers                             |


## plugin support

New sink types can be implemented by writing custom plugins conforming to the `Sink` interface.

A sink plugin must handle:

1. Receiving structured event data
2. Executing the sink logic (write, send, store, etc.)
3. Reporting any delivery failures

## best practices

- Use `stdout` during development or for real-time inspection.
- Use `file` for persistent audit trails.
- Use `http` for integrations with external APIs or services.
- Avoid overloading external sinks â€” include retries or buffering where necessary.
