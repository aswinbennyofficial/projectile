## overview

The event router is a plugin-based system that connects event sources to sinks with optional conditional filtering and transformations.

It enables rule-based routing, decoupling producers from consumers while remaining lightweight and extensible.

## objectives

- Decouple data producers and consumers
- Enable rule-based event routing
- Allow dynamic plugin support for sources, sinks, transforms, and condition evaluation
- Provide structured pipelines for observability and automation



## components

| Component     | Description                                                  |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| source        | Entry point for events (e.g., webhook, http poller)          |
| sink          | Destination to forward events (e.g., file, http, notify)     |
| route         | Connects sources to sinks using conditions                   |
| condition     | Filters events using logical expressions on event fields     |
| transform     | Optional plugin to modify event payloads                     |
| plugin        | Custom source, sink, transform, or condition logic loader    |

## flow

1. Source receives or generates an event.
2. If decoding is configured, the raw event is parsed.
3. The event is evaluated against route conditions.
4. If matched, the event may be transformed.
5. Event is forwarded to one or more sinks.

## use cases

- Logging incoming webhooks to multiple outputs
- Routing events based on alert type to notification services
- Scraping JSON data and forwarding results to a database or REST endpoint
- Observability pipelines for audit or ingestion systems
