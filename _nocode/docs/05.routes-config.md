# routes.yaml

This file defines how incoming events from various **sources** are routed to one or more **sinks**, optionally using **conditional rules** evaluated through a lightweight expression engine (`eval`).

---

## General Structure

```yaml
version: v1

routes:
  - name: <route-name>          # Unique identifier
    source: <source-name>       # Must match a defined source in infra.yaml

    # Option 1: Direct fanout to sinks
    sinks:
      - <sink-name-1>
      - <sink-name-2>

    # Option 2: Conditional routing using rules
    rules:
      - condition: <expression>   # Expression evaluated per event
        sinks:
          - <sink-name-A>

      - condition: <expression>   # Another branch
        sinks:
          - <sink-name-B>

      - condition:                # Default/fallback (no condition)
        sinks:
          - <sink-name-default>
```


## Example
```yaml
version: v1

routes:
  - name: main_fanout
    source: webhook-main
    sinks:
      - stdout-log
      - file-logger
      - notify-service

  - name: scraper_eval
    source: scraper
    rules:
      - condition: event.status == "warning" && event.usage > 80
        sinks:
          - notify-service

      - condition: event.warning == "ok"
        sinks:
          - stdout-log

      - condition: # all other cases
        sinks:
          - file-logger
```

## Explanation: `eval` Engine

The `eval` engine is a small, safe expression evaluator that enables conditional routing based on event content. It's used in the `condition:` fields under `rules`.
Projectile uses [expr-lang](https://expr-lang.org/) .

### Features:
- Evaluates expressions against the incoming `event` object.
- Supports:
  - Boolean logic: `&&`, `||`, `!`
  - Comparisons: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
  - Access to nested fields: `event.status`, `event.usage`, etc.
  - Default fallback by omitting `condition`

### Example Expressions

```yaml
condition: event.status == "warning"
condition: event.usage > 80 && event.status == "critical"
condition: event.meta.env == "prod" || event.region == "us-east"
```

You can assume `event` is a JSON-like object decoded from the source payload. The eval engine parses and runs these conditions per incoming event.
