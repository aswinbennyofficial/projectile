## sources

Sources are the origin points of events in the system. Each source listens for or generates events and passes them into the routing pipeline.

Supported source types include webhooks and scheduled HTTP polling.

## structure

Each source has:

- A unique name used in route configuration.
- A `type` indicating the plugin (e.g., `webhook`, `http-poller`).
- A `config` section with plugin-specific settings.

## configuration format

```yaml
sources:
  <source-name>:
    type: <plugin-name>
    config:
      <plugin-specific-fields>
```

## built-in source types

### webhook

Passively receives HTTP POST requests at a given path and decodes the payload.

```yaml
sources:
  webhook-main:
    type: webhook
    config:
      path: /webhook/main
      method: POST
```

#### fields

| Field  | Type   | Description                   |
|--------|--------|-------------------------------|
| path   | string | URL path to listen on         |
| method | string | HTTP method (usually POST)    |

### http-poller

Actively polls a URL at fixed intervals and emits responses as events.

```yaml
sources:
  post-fetcher:
    type: http-poller
    config:
      url: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1
      method: GET
      headers:
        Accept: application/json
      body: ""
      interval: 10s
```

#### fields

| Field     | Type             | Description                                  |
|-----------|------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| url       | string           | Target URL to poll                           |
| method    | string           | HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.)                |
| headers   | map<string,string> | Optional headers to send                    |
| body      | string           | Optional request body                        |
| interval  | duration string  | Time interval between polls (e.g., `10s`)    |

## plugin support

Additional source types can be added by writing custom plugins that implement the `Source` interface and registering them via the plugin registry.

Plugins must handle:

1. Event generation or ingestion
2. Emitting a structured event payload
3. Proper shutdown and cleanup on exit

## best practices

- Use webhook for external push-based integrations.
- Use http-poller for scraping periodic data from REST endpoints.
- Keep polling intervals reasonable to avoid rate limits.
- Give meaningful source names as they are referenced in routes.
